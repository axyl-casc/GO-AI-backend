# About

## PLAY

The play page is designed for simplicity. Players can place a stone, and the game progresses automatically. Pressing **New Game** will start a fresh game with the **komi, board size, rules, and AI settings** preconfigured by the program.

Game modes include:

- **Normal**: A standard game of Go.
- **Chinese**: The game starts with a stone on each corner, alternating in color. This setup follows traditional placement for even games.
- **Handicap**: The white AI is stronger, but Black starts with handicap stones placed on the board.

### Challenge Mode

Occasionally, a **Challenge Mode** button appears, launching a non-standard game variant. The options are intentionally a surprise for the player.

## PUZZLES

This section generates a **Go puzzle** (Tsumego) for the player to solve. An **info box** at the top provides relevant hints or explanations.

## LEARN

Lessons **unlock progressively** as players advance through different levels. Interactive tutorials guide players through practical scenarios, ensuring a hands-on approach to understanding Go concepts. The system adapts to the player's skill level, offering personalized challenges. The learning system aims to guide beginners toward stronger play.
