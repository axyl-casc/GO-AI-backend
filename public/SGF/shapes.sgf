PW[White]PB[Black]LB[ee:A]C[In this lesson, you will learn a few fundamental shapes in Go and gain an understanding of some essential terminology.

Each shape has specific characteristics and strategic uses in Go. Some are used to extend a group’s liberties, some for connection, and others for efficient movement across the board.

Play on A to continue.]
;B[ee]LB[fb:F][cd:E][fe:A][ge:B][he:C][df:D]C[Good work. You just played on the middle of the board, known as tengen. This central position can influence the whole board and is often used in handicap games.

Now, let's explore some common shapes in Go. Click any letter to view details:
- **A: Nobi** (Extension) - Strengthens the connection of a stone by extending directly.
- **B: Ikken Tobi** (One-Space Jump) - A quick, light move used for development.
- **C: Nikken-hiraki** (Two-Space Extension) - Spreads influence efficiently while maintaining connection.
- **D: Kosumi** (Diagonal Move) - Helps maintain stability and defend against attacks.
- **E: Keima** (Knight's Move) - A flexible move that balances attack and defense.
- **F: Ogeima** (Large Knight’s Move) - Covers more distance but can be cut more easily.

Each of these moves has advantages and is used in different board situations.]
(;B[fe]LB[ed:1][fd:2][de:6][ge:3][ef:5][ff:4]C[**Nobi (Extension)** - This is a simple yet powerful move. It connects to an existing stone directly, increasing the group's liberties. While it may seem slow, it provides stability and helps a group avoid being cut apart.])
(;B[ge]CR[fe]LB[ed:3][gd:4][de:1][he:5][ef:2][gf:6]C[**Ikken Tobi (One-Space Jump)** - A light move that helps a stone advance while maintaining flexibility. The numbered locations indicate important liberties to watch out for, while the circled spot marks a potential weakness where an opponent might cut. This move is often used to escape or expand.])
(;B[he]CR[fe][ge]LB[ed:1][hd:6][de:2][ie:5][ef:3][hf:4]C[**Nikken-hiraki (Two-Space Extension)** - This move spreads influence across the board while maintaining reasonable stability. It is commonly used in the opening to stake out territory while staying connected.])
(;B[df]CR[de][ef]LB[ed:3][fe:4][cf:2][dg:1]C[**Kosumi (Diagonal Move)** - A defensive shape that helps reinforce a stone and reduce weaknesses. It is often used to make a position more solid and prevent cuts. However, it is not as fast as jumping forward.])
(;B[cd]CR[dd][de]LB[cc:4][bd:5][ed:3][ce:6][fe:2][ef:1]C[**Keima (Knight’s Move)** - A flexible move that creates space while still maintaining a connection to the original stone. The keima is an important shape in both attack and defense, often used in invasions. However, it has a cutting point that an opponent may exploit.])
(;B[fb]CR[eb][ec][fc][ed][fd][fe]LB[fa:4][gb:3][de:1][ef:2]C[**Ogeima (Large Knight’s Move)** - This move covers more distance than a regular knight’s move but is more vulnerable to being cut. It is useful for rapid expansion but must be played with caution.]))
