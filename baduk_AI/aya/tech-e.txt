Following are sample feature of Aya.

I put some photos of Computer Olympiad in Graz, 23-27 November.
http://207.218.206.38/~admin82/photo/graz2003/graz2003.html

And my program Aya won 9x9 tournament luckily.
But in 19x19 result was 4 wins and 6 losses.
I think deep full board search might work well in small Go board.

Aya search 4-5 plies in 19x19, and 6-7 plies in 9x9.
Nodes per second is 200-300 nps in 19x19 and 500-600 nps in 9x9
 (Pentium3M 1.13GHz).
Evaluation function includes strings capture and some connections search.
Life and death, eye-shape recognition are static.

Moves are generated from simple stone shape pattern.
Life and death, eye-shape and connection points from evaluation function
 are also generated.

The moves around weaker and bigger stones get higher temporary value.

Number of moves limit each 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 depth are 50,20,10,10,10,10,10.
In first depth(root) and two depth all moves are generated.
And over 3 depth, Aya generates only nearby last moves and around getting
 weak stones by last opponent move.

These idea are mainly from Haruka, Japanese strong Go program's
 explanation.
There is its PDF (in Japanese)

And you can see Mr. Kishimoto's translation.

> Just to be sure, is this speed in nps and not knps?

Sure. It's nps. But in string capture, nps is about 380,000.
Go's evaluation function is very heavy.

And I'm sorry, I made a mistake in URL.
