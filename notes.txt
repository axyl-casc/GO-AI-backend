I created a beginner-friendly Go program that starts with an easy AI and gradually increases in difficulty as you play. Try it out here: https://zxnashx.itch.io/beginner-go-game. (Windows only)

So far, it has worked well on the computers I've tested. My goal was to make each game feel unique and keep the experience fresh through random challenges and a variety of AI opponents.

I'd love to hear your thoughts! Any feedback would be greatly appreciated: https://forms.gle/tSRa7JJkYUg7eswz6
